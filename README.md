# Game-of-Life
Game of Life is a mathematical game simulating cellular automaton, devised my the British mathematician John H. Conway. The rule is simple; the initial state is a rectangular grid of any size, populated with cells that are either dead or alive. The evolution states are solely determined by the initial state, and there is nothing the player can do about it, other than setting a different initial state. The cells of the state are determined by the status of the cells in the previous state, with the following rules:

Neighbors refer to the eight adjacent cells.
* Cells with less than two alive neighbors die.
